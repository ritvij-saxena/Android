# Android: SpinnerView with Firebase 
A simple android project in which there is a client end and an admin end. 
The Client can access the real-time database which is actually a .csv converted into a .json file and imported to the firebase database. (ie; converted row and column data to key and value pair). The client has to choose two keys from the spinner list and the resulting value is printed on the screen.
Instead row and column access, we search the value like key1=>key2=>"value".(More or Less similar to row and column) 
  
The admin can broadcast messages (solution that works but not advisable) and can add/delete the data in the database.
