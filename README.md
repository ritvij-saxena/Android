# Android
A simple project in which there is client and admin. Client can access the real-time database which is actually a .csv converted into a .json file and imported to the firebase database. (ie; converted row and column data to key and value pair). The admin can broadcast messages (solution that works but not advisable) and can add/delete the data in the database.
